# 90prime
General repo for everything related to 90Prime (docs, diagrams, thoughts).

## Welcome!
Welcome to the 90Prime v2.0 upgrade page. 

## How To Use This Repo
Upload anything related to 90Prime that doesn't fit in its own repo. This is mainly documentaion, images, diagrams and etc.

Think of this repository as the hub of the 90prime overhaul. There is no such thing as *too* much information.

Currently, we are **not** using the Wiki page or Projects.
