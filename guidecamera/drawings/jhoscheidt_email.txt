Hi All,

I brought down the binders from the mountain. After talking to Diana, she suggested we just scan the documents at Steward since they were only 11"x17". There are two PDF files designating which binder the files came from. The some of the drawings from binder 2 had revision notes on them. I think most of them are duplicates from binder 1 but they were included to be complete. I do not know if the drawings attached were the final prints used to build the system but at least they show most of the guider components.

Thank you Diana for helping with this!

Cheers,
Joe
